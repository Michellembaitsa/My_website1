            <h1>Why humor is important,through the lens of Trevor Noah's life..</h1>
            <p>
                Imagine getting out of being mugged because you were able to pose as a thief! Some would say that is crazy, insane even,but I think that was a genius move and I almost cracked my rib laughing as I read about it and other ridiculous narrations throughout
                his book.I am familiar with Trevor’s humor from his various stand up comedy shows, but what his book introduced me to was a glimpse into his early life and it comes with no surprise, that even as a young man during apartheid in South Africa,
                Trevor developed a coping mechanism which has turned him into a household name.
                <p>Humor can get you out of trouble, at least, that worked for Trevor.
                    <br>Growing up, people assumed he was a white man, and at the time it was not common for the “walungu” to understand the native languages. One day he was walking down a street and a group of Zulu men were conversing in Zulu with the
                    intention to mug him, only for him to turn around and speak their language.
                    <i>”Yo, guys,why don’t we just mug someone together?I’m ready, let’s do it.”</i> This was a situation that could have gone bad for him, but he was not only able to turn it around,he was also able to make the men acknowledge him as
                    more than his skin color just by his humor, they felt he was “theirs”.
                    <i>”Oh sorry...we thought you were something else..we were trying to steal from white people.Have a good day man”.</i>
                </p>Humor can enable you to make friends. It’s safe to say everyone enjoys a good laugh and we usually gravitate towards
                <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_laughter_brings_us_together ">people who make us laugh.</a> people who make us laugh. In the book, Trevor describes himself as a loner,who figured out very quickly that he was
                good and that 's how he managed to make himself friendships at school. In his own words,<i>”you don't have to be accepted for everything you are, just the one part of yourself that you are willing to share.For me it was humor.I learned
                that even though i didn't belong to one group,I could be a part of any group that was laughing...I wasn't popular ,but i wasn't an outcast.”</i> In his book we get to see the privileges and the struggles that the colour of Trevor’s skin
                accorded him.It is interesting to see how he finds humor even in dark times. I would encourage anyone who has not read this book to get themselves a copy.
