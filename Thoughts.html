            <h1>Birds In A Cage.</h1>
            <p>
                <i>“Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him,
                there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted
                to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage”</i> </p>

            <p>In his book, Born a crime, Trevor Noah goes on to narrate the abuse his mother endured in the hands of her husband. His mother, a free spirit, was in a marriage that expected unquestioning obedience from her.The husband came from a community
                where women were subservient, Patricia Nombuyiselo was not,she was a free spirit, ahead of her time and for that,she paid the price in form of physical abuse.Why did she stay?You may ask, but that’s just it, it 's never easy to get out
                of abusive relationships, It is a
                <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/relationships/cycle-of-abuse"> cycle</a>,there is always a calmness before the storm that falsely reassures the victim that their abuser will stop the abuse. It is 2021 and intimate partner violence
                continues to take lives and those left alive do not leave unscathed.Where are we going wrong as a society?
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps, we could start at where we reinforce The Patriarchy.
                <br>The narrative of men being in power over women is not unique to Patricia's experience.Our societies have for years ensured that the woman 's place remained in the kitchen,according to the toxic ideology,A woman is to be seen,not heard.Thank
                universe btw, for the
                <a href="suffraggetes">Suffraggets</a> who would paved way for attempts at gender equality decades later.Strides have been made towards gender equality but I strongly believe that patriachal societies are still deeply ensuring structural
                violence continues.In the book we see an occassion where Patricia goes to the police for help after an instance of physical abuse, but they flat out refused to help her not even when she was shot in the face, did Patricia get help from
                the police.
                <br>It is important for us as a society to stop looking at victims of abuse questioning why they do not leave but rather closely pay attention to what we do in our everyday lives that support objectification and discrimination of women
                and from there, help dismantle the behaviors in our own little ways.</section>
