                of self values which she has held on to and have been her compass to finding good opportunities for herself. Resilience is her top value and has kept her focused on challenging herself to make the most out of her life.One of her favorite
                quotes is by Rosa Parks,<i>"To bring out change, you must not be afraid to take the first step.We will fail when we fail to try. "</i>
